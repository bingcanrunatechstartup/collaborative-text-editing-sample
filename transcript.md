Hey. I would like to write a collaborative text editor frontend today. The tech stack used is React, Quill for the text editor, and yjs for CRDT. Can you guide me through how to do it? Show the code and explain step by step. Begin with basic setup and adding the Quill editor into view. Thanks.

Sure! I can help you with that. Here's a brief overview of how to set up a collaborative text editor using React, Quill and yjs:

1. First, you'll need to create a new React project using `create-react-app` and install the necessary dependencies: `quill`, `react-quill`, and `yjs`.

2. Next, you'll need to import the necessary components from these libraries into your project.

3. Then, you can add a Quill editor component into your view by using the `ReactQuill` component from the `react-quill` library.

4. After that, you'll need to set up yjs to enable real-time collaboration between multiple users.

Would you like more detailed instructions on any of these steps?

Yes, please elaborate on step 3 and show the code. I would like to enable history in quill. Show me how to add two button for undo/redo functionality.

Sure! Here's an example of how you can add a Quill editor component into your view and enable history for undo/redo functionality:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactQuill from 'react-quill';
import 'react-quill/dist/quill.snow.css';

class Editor extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { text: '' };
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
  }

  handleChange(value) {
    this.setState({ text: value });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <ReactQuill
          value={this.state.text}
          onChange={this.handleChange}
          modules={{
            toolbar: [
              [{ 'header': [1, 2, false] }],
              ['bold', 'italic', 'underline','strike', 'blockquote'],
              [{'list': 'ordered'}, {'list': 'bullet'}, {'indent': '-1'}, {'indent': '+1'}],
              ['link', 'image'],
              ['clean']
            ],
            history: {
              delay: 1000,
              maxStack: 50,
              userOnly: true
            }
          }}
        />
        <button onClick={() => this.quillRef.getEditor().history.undo()}>Undo</button>
        <button onClick={() => this.quillRef.getEditor().history.redo()}>Redo</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default Editor;
```

This code creates a new `Editor` component that uses the `ReactQuill` component to render a Quill editor in the view. The `modules` prop is used to configure the toolbar and enable the history module for undo/redo functionality. Two buttons are also added to allow the user to undo/redo changes.

Is there anything else you would like to know?

Thanks. I want to update this code to use function component in React and React hooks if that's possible. After that, I want to integrate yjs for collaborative editing on the quill text editor we have. Some context: I want to use indexeddb as the database provider to enable offline functionality, and to use webrtc for connection provider. Is it possible to show the list of participant that are currently concurrently editing? If yes, display them as a list of random avatar that when hovered will show their name/id as tooltip or alt text.

Sure! Here's an example of how you can update the `Editor` component to use a function component and React hooks:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import ReactQuill from 'react-quill';
import 'react-quill/dist/quill.snow.css';

const Editor = () => {
  const [text, setText] = useState('');

  const handleChange = (value) => {
    setText(value);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <ReactQuill
        value={text}
        onChange={handleChange}
        modules={{
          toolbar: [
            [{ 'header': [1, 2, false] }],
            ['bold', 'italic', 'underline','strike', 'blockquote'],
            [{'list': 'ordered'}, {'list': 'bullet'}, {'indent': '-1'}, {'indent': '+1'}],
            ['link', 'image'],
            ['clean']
          ],
          history: {
            delay: 1000,
            maxStack: 50,
            userOnly: true
          }
        }}
      />
      <button onClick={() => this.quillRef.getEditor().history.undo()}>Undo</button>
      <button onClick={() => this.quillRef.getEditor().history.redo()}>Redo</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Editor;
```

This code updates the `Editor` component to use a function component and the `useState` hook to manage the state of the text in the editor.

To integrate yjs for collaborative editing on the Quill editor and use indexeddb as the database provider and webrtc for connection provider, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies: `yjs`, `y-indexeddb`, `y-webrtc`, and `y-quill`.

2. Import these libraries into your project.

3. Create a new yjs document and set up indexeddb as the database provider and webrtc as the connection provider.

4. Bind your Quill editor instance to yjs using the `Y.QuillBinding` class from the `y-quill` library.

5. To show a list of participants that are currently concurrently editing, you can use yjs's awareness protocol to keep track of user information such as their name or id.

Here's an example of how you can do this:

```javascript
import * as Y from 'yjs';
import { IndexeddbPersistence } from 'y-indexeddb';
import { WebrtcProvider } from 'y-webrtc';
import QuillBinding from "y-quill";
// ...

const doc = new Y.Doc();
const indexeddbProvider = new IndexeddbPersistence('my-doc', doc);
const webrtcProvider = new WebrtcProvider('my-doc', doc);

// ...

const quillBinding = new QuillBinding(quil

please continue, thanks.

Sure! Here's the rest of the example code that shows how to integrate yjs for collaborative editing on the Quill editor and use indexeddb as the database provider and webrtc for connection provider:

```javascript
import * as Y from 'yjs';
import { IndexeddbPersistence } from 'y-indexeddb';
import { WebrtcProvider } from 'y-webrtc';
import QuillBinding from "y-quill";
// ...

const doc = new Y.Doc();
const indexeddbProvider = new IndexeddbPersistence('my-doc', doc);
const webrtcProvider = new WebrtcProvider('my-doc', doc);

// ...

const quillBinding = new QuillBinding(quillRef.getEditor(), doc.getText('quill'), webrtcProvider.awareness);

// ...

const handleMouseOver = (e) => {
  const userId = e.target.getAttribute('data-userid');
  const userInfo = webrtcProvider.awareness.getStates().get(parseInt(userId));
  if (userInfo) {
    e.target.setAttribute('title', userInfo.name);
  }
};

return (
  <div>
    <ReactQuill
      // ...
    />
    <button onClick={() => this.quillRef.getEditor().history.undo()}>Undo</button>
    <button onClick={() => this.quillRef.getEditor().history.redo()}>Redo</button>
    <ul>
      {[...webrtcProvider.awareness.getStates().keys()].map((userId) => (
        <li key={userId}>
          <img src={`https://api.adorable.io/avatars/285/${userId}.png`} data-userid={userId} onMouseOver={handleMouseOver} alt="User Avatar" />
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  </div>
);
```

This code creates a new yjs document and sets up indexeddb as the database provider and webrtc as the connection provider. Then it binds the Quill editor instance to yjs using the `Y.QuillBinding` class from the `y-quill` library.

To show a list of participants that are currently concurrently editing, it uses yjs's awareness protocol to keep track of user information such as their name or id. It maps over the keys of the awareness states to generate a list of user avatars. When a user hovers over an avatar, it displays their name or id using a tooltip.

Is there anything else you would like to know?

I have a few questions/requests on the code above. 1. Is it true that doc.getText('quill') is a SharedType? Can you explain its role or purpose? 2. When a user join, how can he/she supply his/her name? Modify code if necessary to allow this. 3. Would like to add a passowrd for webrtc to prevent man in the middle attack. 4. How can I detect whether I am offline? Show this status as an offline image to let the user know.
